# Validate sequence 
"""This is a problem that asks us to create a function that will check to see if a sequence of numbers is a subsequence of a given array.

A subsequence of an array is a set of integers that don’t have to be adjacent in the given array but are in the same order as they appear in the array.

For example, given an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], a valid subsequence would be [2,4,6,8,10]. The numbers aren’t directly next to each other, but they are in the same order as when these integers were in the original array.

Something to note is that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of a given array input. """
